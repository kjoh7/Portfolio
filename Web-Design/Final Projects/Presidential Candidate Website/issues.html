    <h3>Middle Class Tax Cuts</h3>
    <p>Vice President Harris and Governor Walz believe that working families deserve a break. That’s why under their plan more than 100 million working and middle-class Americans will get a tax cut. They will do this by restoring two tax cuts designed to help middle class and working Americans: the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit. 
    Through these two programs, millions of Americans get to keep more of their hard-earned income. They will also expand the Child Tax Credit to provide a $6,000 tax cut to families with newborn children. They believe no child in America should live in poverty, and these actions would have a historic impact. Harris/Walz will ensure the wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations pay their fair share.</p>

    <h3>Reproductive Rights</h3>
    <p>Since Roe v. Wade was overturned, Vice President Harris has driven the Administration’s strategy to defend reproductive freedom and safeguard the privacy of patients and providers. As Governor, Tim Walz led Minnesota to become the first state to pass a law protecting a woman’s right to choose following the overturning of Roe. 
    Vice President Harris has traveled America and heard the stories of women hurt by Trump abortion bans. Stories of couples just trying to grow their family, cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. Stories of women miscarrying in parking lots, developing sepsis, losing the ability to ever have children again — all because doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients. As President, she will never allow a national abortion ban to become law. </p>

    <h3>Trump's Project 2025</h3>
    <p>Donald Trump is a threat to our fundamental rights and freedoms. He brags that he is “proudly” responsible for handpicking Supreme Court Justices who overturned Roe, unleashing Trump Abortion Bans in states across the country, putting women’s lives at risk and threatening doctors and other health providers with jail time. He said there should be “punishment” for women who have an abortion and calls abortion bans “a beautiful thing to watch.” If elected, Trump will ban abortion nationwide, restrict access to birth control, force states to report on women’s miscarriages and abortions, and jeopardize access to IVF. Trump and his allies continue to demonize and attack LGBTQI+ individuals and families. His Project 2025 agenda will eliminate federal rules that protect LGBTQI+ Americans from discrimination. </p>
